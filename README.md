# Javascript
# Learning JS from Udemy

 Javascript is a high-level, Object-Oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

 - No need to worry about memory management
 - Based on objects for storing most kinds of data
 - we can use different styles of programming
 - Executed from top to bottom
  
 JS adds the dynamic and interactive aspect of the web when compared to HTML and CSS- Also allows us to build web apps.

 - JS can also be used on back-end apps with node.js
 - JS can be used front-end with Frameworks like React, Angular and Vue

## Releases

 2015 - ES6 (ECMAScript) from ES6 it is called modern JS in which gets updates every year

## Objects and Primitives
 
 A value is either:
 - An Object 
 ```js
 let me = {
    name: "Jonas"
 };
 ```
 - Primitive
 ```js
  let firstName = "Jonas";
  let age = 30;
  ```
 
 ### 7 Primitive data types:
 
 1. Number - floating point (used for decimals and integers)
 2. String - sequence of characters (used for text)
 3. Boolean - true / false (used for decisions)
 4. Undefined - Value taken by a variable not yet defined (empty value)
 5. Null - also means empty value
 6. Symbol (ES2015) - Value that is unique and cant be changed
 7. BigInt (ES2020) - large integer 

 Javascript has dynamic typing - we dont have to manually define the data type of the value stored in the variable (done automatically) 
 
 **Value has type, NOT variable**

 let is used to declare variables that can change later

 var shouldn't be used as it is legacy - works similar to let
